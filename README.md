# example-repo for getting started with Git and GitHub

Git and GitHub are tools for version control and collaborative work. Git is a program that can be 
run on your own computer, or as a server. GitHub is a web app that adds an intuitive
user interface to Git running on GitHub servers. 

Version control systems (VCS) provide a way to track who has made what changes to code, and when
changes were made. Git is the VCS in this case. 

Please read up on Git and GitHub (this tutorial is helpful to get going fast:
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). Then, 

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a branch, name it anything you like
3. Add a file that has your name as the file name, and contains a short bio of yourself
4. Commit the changes to the branch you created
5. Push the branch to GitHub
6. Open a pull request to merge your changes

After this, you will be ready to start work on the metacorps repository!
